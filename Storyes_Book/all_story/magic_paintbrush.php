    <h3>The Magic Paintbrush and Ma Liang</h3>
    <p class="fs-5 ms-5">There was once a young boy named Ma Liang. He lived in a small village in China. He was poor
        and friendly, and he loved to draw. His love for painting was too much so he drew paintings all over the place. <br><br>


        He had a dream one night that an old man handed him a magical paintbrush and told him to use it to help the less
        fortunate. He found the magic paintbrush on his desk when he awoke. <br><br>

        He began to use the paintbrush anytime someone needed assistance from that day on. He designed a river and it
        came to life when he noticed that people didn't have enough water to utilize in the fields. <br><br>


        He drew a cow and it came to life when he observed how difficult it was for people to till the field. The cow
        might readily be used to plow the ground. <br><br>


        As a result, whenever he saw anyone in distress, he would use his magical paintbrush to assist them. The magic
        paintbrush was well-known back then. <br><br>


        However, in the town, there lived a wealthy man who was cruel, and he was determined to steal the young guy's
        paintbrush so that he could use it to become even wealthier. He realized that by bringing things to life and
        preserving them, he could make a lot of money, so he dispatched some people to Ma Liang's residence and sent him
        to prison. <br><br>

        He was overjoyed when he finally got his hands on the paintbrush, and he brought his pals around to see his new
        acquisition. He drew many pictures, but none of them seemed to come alive for him. <br><br>


        He was furious because the paintbrush was not working for him, so he summoned Ma Liang. <br><br>


        "If you create some drawings for me and bring them to life, I will set you free," he stated to the young guy. <br><br>


        Ma Liang did not want to serve such a horrible man, but he had a solution. "I can help you," he said to the
        wicked man, "but you must obey your words." <br><br>


        â€˜What would you like me to draw?" he asked. <br><br>


        The rich man stated, "I'd like to have a golden mountain. I'll go there to look for gold." <br><br>


        However, the young man sketched a sea first, followed by a golden mountain far away from the water. <br><br>


        "Draw a massive ship immediately," the wealthy man requested. <br><br>


        The young man drew a large ship and grinned silently. The rich guy hopped onto the ship and set out to find the
        treasure, but when the ship reached the middle of the sea, Ma Liang created a tremendous wave that sank the
        ship, and the rich man was never seen again in the village. <br><br>


        As the wicked man and his helpers died, Ma Liang returned to the village and lived a long and happy life. He
        continued to help the ones who are in need and was admired by everyone. </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="fs-5 ms-5">We can conclude the story with the moral lesson that greed is a harmful thing. As depicted in
        the magic paintbrush story, the rich man died because he was too greedy and wanted to become even richer. <br><br>
