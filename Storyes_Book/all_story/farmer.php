    <h3>The Story of an Honest Farmer and a Cheater Baker</h3>
    <p class="fs-5 ms-5">Once upon a time, in a small town, a farmer and a baker did business with each other. In
        exchange for 1 Kg of butter that the farmer brought every day, the baker would give the farmer 1 Kg of bread
        loaf. <br><br>


        The two did business for quite a long time together, which developed a good bond between them and they became
        friends. <br><br>


        One day, the baker decided to check the weight of the butter to see if he was getting 1 Kg as promised. When he
        measured the butter, he found that the farmer was not giving him 1 Kg of butter, it was less than that. This
        made the baker very angry and he decided to take the farmer to court to get justice.</p>

    <h3>The Farmer’s Trial</h3>
    <p class="fs-5 ms-5">When the farmer appeared before the judge in a court, the judge asked him if he used any
        machine to measure the butter. The poor farmer replied, “Your Honour, I do not have a proper measuring machine
        but I do have a scale.” The judge was confused and asked, “How did you weigh your butter then?” <br><br>


        The farmer explained, “Your Honour, every day the baker buys butter from me and I buy bread loaf from him. So,
        every day when the baker brings his bread loaf, which weighs 1 Kg, I put it on the scale. Then I put the butter
        on the scale to match the weight of the butter. I give the baker the same weight in butter as he gives me bread
        loaf. So, it is not my fault. It is actually the baker’s fault.”  <br><br>
        This left the baker shocked. The judge pronounced the baker a cheater and punished him.</p>
